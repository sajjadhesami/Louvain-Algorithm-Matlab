# Louvain-Algorithm-Matlab
This is an implementation of Louvain algorithm in MATLAB. The details of the algorithm can be found (here)[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/2008/10/P10008/meta].
The implementation uses an array of MALTAB structs to save the results of the algorithm at each stage and plots the modularity value at every iteration.
To use the script, you should add ComDetTB from (here) [https://github.com/mmitalidis/ComDetTB] (which is used for computing modularity values). The script comes along with a few datasets. These datasets and other similar datasets can be found (here)[https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/Newman/].
